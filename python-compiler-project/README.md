# Python Compiler Project

This project is a simple Python compiler that includes a lexer, parser, and compiler to transform source code into executable code or bytecode.

## Project Structure

```
python-compiler-project
├── src
│   ├── lexer.py       # Responsible for tokenizing the input source code.
│   ├── parser.py      # Handles parsing of tokens generated by the lexer.
│   ├── compiler.py     # Compiles the parsed code into executable code or bytecode.
│   └── utils.py       # Contains utility functions for the lexer, parser, and compiler.
├── requirements.txt    # Lists the dependencies required for the project.
└── README.md           # Documentation for the project.
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd python-compiler-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the compiler, you can run the main script (to be implemented) that utilizes the Lexer, Parser, and Compiler classes to process your source code.

## Overview

- **Lexer**: Tokenizes the input source code into meaningful symbols.
- **Parser**: Analyzes the tokens and constructs a parse tree.
- **Compiler**: Transforms the parse tree into executable code or bytecode.
